# Name:


##### Note: The exam is open notes (printed or electronic) but closed to Internet searches. You can access pyparrot documentation, class repositories on GitHub, and the materials on the course website.


### Question 1 [10 points]

Give an example of a multi-agent system. Explain why it is a multi-agent system and what makes an agent in the system an "agent" as we define that term in this class. 



### Question 2 [10 points]

Give an example of a cooperative multi-robot system. Concentrate on describing how the  cooperation occurs between multiple robots in your example. Name one potential benefit of cooperative multi-robot systems. Name one potential disadvantage of cooperation among multiple robots.



### Question 3 [10 points (5 points each)]
Assuming you have a multi-robot system that cooperates to assemble one piece of an Ikea furniture (for example, a single chair), answer the following questions. You can assume that there are at least two autonomous and mobile robots comprising the system. 

1. Should the robots in this system use implicit or explicit communication or no communication? Justify your answer.
2. What information should be communicated? If no communication is required, how do the robots complete the task in a collaborative manner? Justify your answer.



### Question 4 [5 points]

In the application of 3D printing what does slicing mean?



### Question 5 [25 points (5 points each)]

In `pyparrot` library the `Bebop` class has a method called `fly_direct`. Describe what each of its parameters does and how the change in value (smaller/larger) affects the flight of the drone. 


### Question 6 [5 points]

What does the following line of a Python program return?

`pics = [img for img in os.listdir(image_folder) if img.endswith(".png")]`


### Question 7 [10 points]

What is OpenCV's `imread` method responsible for? Give an example in Python statement(s) and describe what your statement(s) inputs and outputs. 


### Question 8 [10 points]

What is OpenCV's `imwrite` method responsible for? Give an example in Python statement(s) and describe what your statement(s) inputs and outputs. 


### Question 9 [5 points]

Provide one example of using computer vision in the field of robotics.


### Question 10 [10 points]

So far in this class you have implemented a couple of applications with drones and reflected on the ethical aspects surrounding the design of those applications. Answer the following questions:
1. What ethical considerations are unique to drones in terms of their design, development, deployment and use?
2. Is a cooperative multi-drone system, where multiple drones work together to accomplish a task, more ethical by default due to the cooperative nature of the system? If not, can it be and how? Justify your answer.
